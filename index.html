Hi I am
<strong>Vatsala Dorairajan</strong>
. I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science from Anna University(KCG College of Technology), Chennai in May 2008.
</p>
<p>Since then, I have worked with PHP(2008-2009),Java(2009-2013),Adobe Flex(2009-2011), Python(hobby projects)(2013-2014), Javascript(Backbone.js mostly)(all along so far), Ruby-Rails(2014-)</p>
<p>The idea of starting this blog is to try and give answers to those questions for which I couldnt find an answer in google search. This, I feel, is a small contribution from my side to the community. Learners and beginners will particularly find this content useful as it is a record of my hands on experiences.</p>
<p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
