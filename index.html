Hi I am **Vatsala Dorairajan**. I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science from Anna University(KCG College of Technology), Chennai in May 2008.

Since then, I have worked with PHP(2008-2009),Java(2009-2013),Adobe Flex(2009-2011), Python(hobby projects)(2013-2014), Javascript(Backbone.js mostly)(all along so far), Ruby-Rails(2014-)

The idea of starting this blog is to try and give answers to those questions for which I couldnt find an answer in google search. This, I feel, is a small contribution from my side to the community. Learners and beginners will particularly find this content useful as it is a record of my hands on experiences.

My Personal Blog is at [Electic Rant](http://eclectic-rant.blogspot.com) and you can find me [here](https://twitter.com/vatsala) on twitter.

Thanks for reading!
